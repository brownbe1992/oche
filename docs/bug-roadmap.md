# Bug Roadmap (functional-defect tracker)

> **Purpose.** The counterpart to `docs/security-audit-roadmap.md`, for
> *functional* bugs — wrong behavior, data-integrity gaps, and correctness
> issues that aren't primarily a security exposure. Same discipline: each entry
> has a stable ID, a severity, the exact location (by function/file, not line
> number, so it survives edits), the concrete misbehavior, a **step-by-step
> fix**, and a **verification** step. Security issues live in the security doc;
> where a functional bug shares a root cause with a security finding, the two
> cross-reference each other rather than duplicating the fix.
>
> **Seeded by** the 2026-07 second-pass audit (the same read that produced
> `security-audit-roadmap.md` Part 4). The stat/achievement *formulas* are not
> re-derived here — they're covered by the 238-case `node:test` suite under
> `backend/test/` (all green as of this writing). This doc tracks the correctness
> gaps that suite doesn't yet assert.

## Severity legend

- **HIGH** — wrong result a normal user will actually hit in ordinary use.
- **MED** — wrong result behind an uncommon-but-reachable path, or a silent
  data-integrity drift that accumulates.
- **LOW** — latent / only reachable by a malformed or hostile client today;
  defense-in-depth correctness.

## BUG-1 — Daily Challenge write path doesn't validate the date/format the read path requires  **(LOW, latent / data-integrity)**

**Status: 🔴 OPEN.**

**Where:** `db.js` `startChallengeAttempt()` and `completeChallengeAttempt()` store
`challenge_date` and `format` via bare `String(...)` with no validation. The *read* side
is asymmetric: `getChallengeStatus()` and `resetChallengeAttempt()` both reject a
`challengeDate` that isn't `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` with a 400, and the streak/longest-streak
walks in `getChallengeStatus()`/`getChallengeHistory()` assume every stored date parses as
`new Date(date + 'T00:00:00Z')`.

**Misbehavior:** the current frontend always sends a valid `YYYY-MM-DD`, so this is latent.
But a malformed or hostile client can persist an attempt row whose date never matches the
regex-guarded reads — it then (a) still counts toward `played`/`completed` in
`getChallengeHistory()` (which does *not* validate), inflating the player's lifetime
"played" tally with a phantom day, and (b) parses to `Invalid Date` in the streak/
longest-streak loops, where the day-gap subtraction yields `NaN` and silently resets a run
to 1 instead of extending it — a quietly wrong "longest streak". A bogus `format` similarly
sits in the table but can never become a personal best (`CHALLENGE_BETTER_DIRECTION[format]`
is `undefined`), so it's dead weight rather than a crash.

**Fix (step by step):**
1. In `startChallengeAttempt()`, validate `challengeDate` with the same
   `^\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}$` regex used on the read side, and validate `format` against the six
   known formats (the keys of `CHALLENGE_BETTER_DIRECTION` already list them). Reject
   otherwise with a 400.
2. In `completeChallengeAttempt()`, validate `challengeDate` the same way (it's used in the
   `UPDATE ... WHERE challenge_date = ?`, so a bad value is a silent no-op today — a 400 is
   clearer).
3. This is the functional face of `security-audit-roadmap.md` **SEC-14**; doing SEC-14's
   challenge-validation step fixes this bug at the same time.

**Verify:** `startChallengeAttempt` with `challengeDate:'2026-7-1'` or `'garbage'`, or
`format:'nope'`, each return 400; a valid attempt still records and streaks compute
correctly.

## BUG-2 — `createGame` accepts an unknown `gameType`, which then silently skews cross-type stats  **(LOW, latent / data-integrity)**

**Status: 🔴 OPEN.**

**Where:** `db.js` `createGame()` sets `resolvedGameType = gameType || 'x01'` with **no**
whitelist, even though `KNOWN_GAME_TYPES` (`['x01','cricket','doubles_practice','chuckin']`)
is already defined in the same file and `_scope()` throws on any type outside it.

**Misbehavior:** the New Game UI only ever sends one of the four known types, so this is
latent. But a game persisted with an unknown `game_type` (e.g. via a direct API call) is
**counted in the unscoped aggregates** — total darts thrown, games played (the
`game_players`/turns joins that don't filter on type) — while being **excluded from every
typed stat query** (`X01_ONLY`, `_scope({gameType:...})`, the Cricket/Doubles/Chuckin
functions). The result is an internally inconsistent profile: the home "games played" /
"darts thrown" counters include a game that contributes to none of the per-type
leaderboards or averages. No crash (the server never *queries* with the unknown type, so
`_scope`'s throw isn't reached), just a quiet drift.

**Fix (step by step):**
1. In `createGame()`, validate `gameType` (when provided) against `KNOWN_GAME_TYPES` and
   reject an unknown value with a 400 — the same whitelist `_scope()` already enforces on
   the read side, applied at the write boundary so bad rows never enter the table.
2. Optionally, add a one-time migration/self-heal that flags or removes any pre-existing
   rows with an unknown `game_type` (there should be none from the shipped UI).
3. Shares a root cause with `security-audit-roadmap.md` **SEC-14** (createGame input
   validation) — fix together.

**Verify:** `createGame({ gameType:'evil', ... })` returns 400; the four known types still
create normally and appear in both the unscoped and typed stats.

## BUG-3 — Admin-username `onclick` handlers rely on a validator elsewhere instead of escaping at the sink  **(LOW, code-hygiene / latent-regression)**

**Status: 🔴 OPEN.** (Cross-ref: `security-audit-roadmap.md` **SEC-12**.)

**Where:** `frontend/index.html` — the `askChangeAdminPassword(...)` / `askDeleteAdmin(...)`
`onclick` handlers in `renderAdminsList()` interpolate `a.username` with **`escapeJs`
only**, inside a double-quoted attribute.

**Misbehavior:** not exploitable today — usernames are validated to
`^[A-Za-z0-9_.-]{3,32}$`, which excludes the `"`/`<`/`>` needed to break out. But the sink
is only safe *because of* a validator two files away; if that regex is ever loosened, this
silently becomes an XSS. It's also inconsistent with the file's own established
`escapeHtml(escapeJs(...))` pattern.

**Fix:** wrap both in `escapeHtml(escapeJs(a.username))` (done as step 2 of SEC-12). Purely
defensive — no behavior change for valid usernames.

**Verify:** covered by the SEC-12 verification once the handlers are wrapped.

## Standing practice

When a functional bug is found: add it here with a repro and a fix outline before fixing,
the same discipline the security doc uses. When it's fixed, flip its Status line to ✅ with
a note on what shipped (and add a `node:test` that would have caught it, per the CLAUDE.md
"every new calculation gets a committed test" convention — a regression guard is what keeps
a fixed bug fixed). A bug whose root cause is shared with a security finding is fixed once,
in whichever doc's step list is more specific, with the other cross-referencing it.
