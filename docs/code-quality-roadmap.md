# Code-Quality Refactors — deferred review findings

> **Status: OPEN — nothing here is started.** Every item below is tracked
> individually on `docs/open-roadmap-items.md` (items 35–45 from the branch
> review, items 46–52 from the first whole-file `/simplify frontend/index.html`
> pass, items 53–59 from the second). This doc is the design context for them,
> in one place, so each can be picked up (or explicitly rejected) on its own.
>
> **Origin:** the 2026-07-20 max-effort code review of the `dev` branch
> (fix commits `878bf52` and `eba350f`). Every *correctness* finding from that
> review was fixed on the spot; these are the **verified-but-deferred**
> maintainability/architecture findings — each was judged too large or too
> behavior-risky to refactor untested in the same pass. None is a bug: the
> current code is correct, just fragile or duplicated in the ways described.
> Items are independent unless a row says otherwise; there is no required
> order.

## Item 35 — Consolidate the 16 `undoLastTurn*` trailers

Every per-game-type `undoLastTurn*()` in `frontend/index.html` ends with the
same ~14-line trailer: mark `snap.voided`, revoke `snap.badgeReverts`, call
`cancelQueuedAchievementsForSnapshot(snap)`, reset `game.darts`/`busted`/
`won`, `DB.deleteLastTurn()`, set a status message, re-render, `pushLive()`.
Sixteen copies exist (≈ index.html 10471, 11037, 11263, 11356, 11458, 11768,
11925, 13419, 13622, 13857, 14203, 14886, 15176, 15477, 15618) and they have
**already drifted**: some copies skip `pushLive()` (Gauntlet, Chuckin,
Checkout Trainer, ATC/ATW — partly deliberate, partly incidental) and some
skip the `game.current` restore.

**Shape:** one `_finishUndo(snap, renderFn, {msg, restoreCurrent, push})`
helper; each mode's function keeps only its game-specific field restores.
The deliberate per-mode differences become explicit options instead of
silent omissions. A fix to the undo protocol (a second badge-revert kind, a
webhook cancel) then lands once instead of 16 times.

## Item 36 — One `winSectionHtml()` for the five "Most X Wins" Home templates

Five `renderHomeTabBody*` functions (`frontend/index.html` ≈ 2745, 2791,
2838, 2881, 2923) embed the identical hof-list HTML template, differing only
in the section title and `homeData` key. A markup/escaping/format change must
be found five times; five copies of interpolated HTML is five XSS-audit
surfaces.

**Shape:** `winSectionHtml(title, rows)` called with
(`"Most Cricket Wins"`, `homeData.cricket.wins`) etc. Pure extraction, no
behavior change — the smallest item on this list.

## Item 37 — Registry-driven resume dispatch (savable ⇒ resumable, structurally)

`resumeGame()` (`frontend/index.html` ≈ 10083) is a hardcoded 13-branch
else-if chain (per-type rebuild call + field overlay + status message), and
`_savedGamePosition()` (`backend/db.js` ≈ 1773) is a second parallel
12-branch copy of the same dispatch with the per-type config-default parsing
duplicated in both. The failure mode is concrete: a future savable mode that
misses the frontend branch hits the else-alert **after**
`getResumeState()` has already consumed the `saved_games` row — the user's
paused game is destroyed. A missed backend branch renders a blank position
label.

**Shape:** a `resume`/`rebuildState` member on each `GAME_TYPES` entry (and a
`position` member on the backend `GAME_TYPE_REGISTRY`), so registering a
savable type without resume support is impossible by construction. This is
the largest single item here; do it with the app runnable for end-to-end
verification of every savable type.

## Item 38 — `savedGamePositionLabel()`: dispatch on `sg.gameType`, not field presence

`savedGamePositionLabel()` (`frontend/index.html` ≈ 10279) picks its label
format by probing which fields exist on the position object (`pos.players`,
`pos.hit`, `pos.round`, `pos.target`, `pos.dmwRound`, …). The backend already
had to invent `dmw`-prefixed field names purely to dodge a collision
(`backend/db.js` ≈ 1830 comment). The next mode's position shape must avoid
seven reserved names or it silently renders another mode's label with
nonsense values — a constraint visible only in a backend comment.

**Shape:** branch on `sg.gameType` (already on the same object and already
used three lines earlier), or a `positionLabel` registry member. Small,
self-contained.

## Item 39 — Derive `NON_SAVABLE_GAME_TYPES` from the backend registry

`NON_SAVABLE_GAME_TYPES = ['doubles_practice','chuckin','checkout_trainer','killer']`
(`frontend/index.html` ≈ 14577) hand-mirrors the backend
`GAME_TYPE_REGISTRY` savable flags (`backend/db.js` ≈ 1638–1659). Nothing
ties them together — a drifted entry either shows a Save button the server
400s, or hides pause/resume for a mode the server supports.

**Shape:** serve the savable list with existing game-type data (or assert
the two lists match in a committed test — the cheap 80% version).

## Item 40 — Declare `newMatchPlayer`'s second-arg shape on the registry

`startGame()` (`frontend/index.html` ≈ 5140) and `resumeGame()` (≈ 10074)
each hardcode their own list of which types' `newMatchPlayer` takes `config`
vs a start score — and the lists already differ (startGame:
cricket|doubles_practice|checkout_trainer; resume: cricket only, plus the
x01 per-player handicap case). They only agree today because the extra types
happen to be non-savable. The next savable config-constructed mode silently
builds resumed players from a number where the constructor expects an
object.

**Shape:** a per-entry declaration (e.g. `ctorArg: 'config' | 'startScore'`)
consumed by both call sites. Folds naturally into item 37 if done together.

## Item 41 — `games.category` as a registry member

The stored `games.category` string comes from a 14-branch gameType ternary
(`frontend/index.html` ≈ 5085) falling through to `String(startScore)`. A
new mode that misses the chain writes category `'501'` **permanently into
its games rows** — polluting X01's category-keyed stats
(`h2hLegsWonByCat`, leaderboard groupings) and league-fixture category
matching, discovered only after bad rows exist.

**Shape:** a `category(config, setup)` member on each `GAME_TYPES` entry
(static label for most, computed for Cricket preset / Halve-It preset /
Doubles targets / Blitz-vs-Freeform), making the fallthrough impossible.

## Item 42 — Live-state keys: per-mode container (or registry-derived allowlist)

`ALLOWED_LIVE_KEYS` (`backend/server.js` ≈ 465) is a ~58-entry hand-kept
flat list; every new mode adds top-level keys in three unlinked places
(`liveSnapshot()` producer, the allowlist, the `display.html` reader). The
silent-strip failure has now shipped **twice** (BUG-28's 7 keys, then
`killerLives`/`checkoutLadder*` — the `/display` fallbacks made both
invisible: plausible-looking wrong defaults, no error).

**Shape:** either one allowlisted per-mode container key (`modeState`,
unrestricted-shape the way `players[]` already is) with per-mode fields
inside it, or derive the allowlist from a shared registry the producer and
reader both consume. Reduces three sync points to zero. Touches the SEC-2
sanitization layer — keep the size cap and the top-level shape validation.

## Item 43 — Id-keyed killer configs (end the name-rewrite class)

Killer's `games.config.numbers` is keyed by player **name** while every
replay path looks up by current name. Three compensating mechanisms now
exist (`_rewriteKillerConfigNames()` on rename and merge, the import-time
re-key in `importPlayerExport()`, and the `reconcileKillerConfigNames()`
boot self-heal) — each added after a real orphaned-assignment bug. Any
future name-mutating path starts broken until someone remembers the rewrite.

**Shape:** migrate `config.numbers` to be keyed by `players.id` (one boot
migration translating existing configs via `game_players`, then delete all
three compensators and re-point `rebuildKillerState()`'s lookup). The
frontend replay uses names; the id→name join already exists at every call
site. Medium effort, permanently removes a whole bug class the hard way the
current fixes only patch.

## Item 44 — Whole-darts-table scan pass over the hot stat queries

Several hot-path queries aggregate the entire `darts` table (the largest
table) or replay entire game-type histories per player, when an indexed
correlated count (`idx_darts_turn` exists) or a single grouped pass would
bound the work:

- `getHomeExtra()`'s `_first9` and `_trebleLess` — four full
  `GROUP BY turn_id` scans per Home load (`backend/db.js` ≈ 2583, 2548).
- `getSessionRecap()`'s `bestLegStmt`/`preLegAvgStmt` — the same subquery
  per active player, plus a lifetime-history grouping per player.
- `getPersonalBests()` — the full-table subquery twice per Player Profile
  view (`legAvgSql`, `bestFirst9`).
- `_h2hWonLegs()`'s shanghai/halve-it loop — `getShanghaiWonLegs()`/
  `getHalveItWonLegs()` once per participant, each internally replaying
  ALL of that type's turns for ALL players before filtering to one
  (O(players × history) per `/api/stats`). Derive each leg's winner once
  and emit all winners (the killer branch's `_replayKillerLegs()` shape).

All grow linearly (or × players) with lifetime history on a synchronous
single-threaded server that also handles live scoring. Item 34 (the
per-game-type stat generalization decision) overlaps the last bullet —
decide them together.

## Item 45 — Home page: lazy per-combo fetches

`renderHome()` fires ~47 aggregate fetches per Home navigation though only
the selected tab+game-type combo renders. Two mitigations already shipped
(stale-while-revalidate paint + the keep-cache-on-error catch); the burst
itself remains and grows with every mode. A real fix fetches per visible
combo in `switchHomeTab()`/`switchHomeGameType()` (with `homeData` caching
per group), or adds one combined endpoint. Touches every `homeTabRenderer` —
needs the app runnable to verify each tab.

# Batch 2 — deferred findings from the whole-file `/simplify frontend/index.html` pass (2026-07-20)

Same origin discipline as above: verified findings, none a live bug (the one
real drift the pass found — `setupStep3HasContent()`'s stale id list hiding
Shanghai/Halve-It's Step 3 options — was fixed on the spot, along with the
helper-bypass, dead-code, and fetch-waste items). These are the remaining
larger refactors, tracked as items 46–52.

## Item 46 — Per-mode option-section wiring as a registry member

The Step 3 option-section mapping lives in four places: the markup
(`#setup-step-3 .setup-section` ids), `setMode()`'s toggles (~3313-3335),
`setGameType()`'s repeat of four of them (~4328-4331), and (until fixed) the
`setupStep3HasContent()` id list — the fourth copy is what drifted. An
`optionsSectionId` member on `GAME_TYPES`/`NEW_GAME_MODE_OPTIONS` would
collapse both toggle sites into loops. Related mirrors worth folding in:
`NEW_GAME_MODE_OPTIONS[].contexts` duplicating the registry's
`soloOnly`/`h2hOnly` flags, and `setMode()`'s three near-identical mode lists
(`isSpecialMode`, `drillGameTypes`, the start-button-label ternary) plus
`startGame()`'s separate `drillModes` — candidates for `isDrill`/`isSpecial`/
`startLabel` fields on the mode entries.

## Item 47 — One `h2hStatsHtml(winner, scope)` with per-type rows

`h2hStatsHtml` / `...Baseball` / `...Shanghai` / `...HalveIt` /
`...PressureChamber` (~12256-12365) are five copies of the same function
differing only in 2-3 `statRow()` metrics, selected in `finishUnit()` by TWO
parallel 5-way ternary chains (game scope and leg scope) whose exclusion sets
differ only via a comment-enforced invariant. A per-type `h2hRows(p, scope)`
registry member (the `legSummary` precedent) deletes four clones and both
chains. ~110 lines → ~40.

## Item 48 — Declarative personal-bests renderers

17 near-identical `renderXxxPersonalBests()` functions (~6981-7253 + the
marathon one) repeat the same scaffold: container guard, empty message,
optional recent-form delta block (verbatim ×4), then `key != null ?
stat-block : ''` rows. The registry already dispatches via
`personalBestsRenderer` — replace the functions with a per-type spec
(`{emptyMsg, stats:[{key,label,fmt}], form:{...}}`) consumed by one generic
renderer. ~280 lines → ~50.

## Item 49 — One leaderboard-row template helper (~20 sites; supersedes item 36's five)

The hof-list row template (`rank/score/player/dates`) is re-implemented
inline in ~20 Home tab boards beyond item 36's five "Most X Wins" copies
(Elo, win-rate, trebleless, ton+, first-9, MPR, RPI, PPR, Halve-It, PC,
Doubles ×2, Blitz, Bob's 27, Ladder, Gauntlet, DMW, Killer, ATC ×2, ATW,
Marathon). One `leaderboardSectionHtml(rows, {score, meta, emptyMsg})`
subsumes item 36 entirely — implement them together. The copies already lag
`hofSection()`'s accessibility upgrades (role=button/aria-expanded).

## Item 50 — One-shot badge award helper

The award block (POST `/api/badges/award` `{once:true}` → `newlyEarned` →
`queueBadge` + `fireMomentCard`) is hand-rolled ~10 times (~6805, 10770,
10787, 10808, 11119, 12116, 12123, 14683, 15474, 15621) and has ALREADY
drifted: only two sites maintain `earnedBadgeCache` (the rest re-fire the
POST every re-trigger), one site skips `queueBadge`, and the undo-snapshot
capture uses three naming conventions. Generalize
`awardCheckoutTrainerBadge()` (which already encapsulates the pattern) into
`awardOnceBadge(player, badgeId, achType, snap, momentOpts)`.

## Item 51 — Per-dart/per-visit badge-progress fetches and profile refetch waste

Three efficiency items sharing one shape (fetch-baseline-once + client-side
tracking, the in-file precedent at ~15572): (a) every X01 visit fetches
`/api/players/around-the-world` per unbadged player (a lifetime-darts
DISTINCT scan per visit); (b) Doubles Practice fetches
`/api/players/doubles-hit-sectors` on every hit dart until Ring Master;
(c) profile navigation re-awaits the full `/api/stats` refresh
unconditionally (`show('player')`) and tab/game-type switches refetch all
~17 profile loads when only the mode-parameterized ones changed; plus
tournament average-seeding fires one heavy personal-bests call per player
when the in-memory stats blob (or one batch endpoint) would do.

## Item 52 — Small shared-pattern helpers (batch)

Low-risk, multi-site idioms worth one helper each, batched: `jsArg()` naming
the `escapeHtml(escapeJs(...))` onclick-argument composition (~24 sites, an
unnamed safety invariant); `openModal(html, focusId)` beside the existing
`closeModal()` (12 builders repeat the innerHTML+unhide+focus tail);
a `registerMilestoneLadders(ladders, flags)` helper for the ~12
BADGE_INFO/ACH_LABELS/ACH_DURATION registration loops (bodies vary slightly —
merge carefully); a countdown-timer factory for the Blitz and No-Warmup
start/stop/tick trios; and a `setPressed(group, chosen)` helper for the ~10
hand-enumerated aria-pressed segmented controls.

---

# Batch 3 — deferred findings from the second `/simplify frontend/index.html` pass (2026-07-20)

Second full-file sweep with batches 1-2 excluded. Fixed on the spot: the three
culture badges missing from every overlay map (blank live headlines — the
BUG-26 class), the un-gated tournament create/walkover writes, ~19 duplicate
`pushLive()` calls (renderers already push; commit sites double-posted every
turn), the undo double-render, `uiAlertErr()` + 25 conversions, the shared
`BOARD_GEOM` dartboard kernel, `X01_CATEGORIES`, the `_seededIndex` →
`_pcSeededIndex` alias, settings collapsible CSS classes (~47 inline styles),
checkout-trainer one-off durations + stale comments, and two dead remnants.
The rest, tracked as items 53–59:

## Item 53 — Game-start construction factory (4 drifted copies)

`startGame()`, `_reallyBeginTournamentMatch()`, `resumeSavedGame`'s literal,
and `beginMarathonLeg()` each hand-write the same ~20-key runtime-state
trailer (darts/busted/won/done, counters, turn logs, one-shot fields), the
same 6-line `earnedBadgeCache` prefetch loop, and (three of them) the same
`recordEvent` game/set/leg-start triple + render/show tail. Drift is visible:
the tournament and marathon literals omit `atcLastDart`/`atwLastDart`.
**Shape:** `baseGameRuntimeState()` factory spread into each literal +
`prefetchEarnedBadges(names)` + a `beginGameSession()` tail helper.

## Item 54 — One leg/set/game progression helper (8 pasted cascades)

The `legsWon++ → set → match` decision tree (webhooks, recordEvent trio,
completeGame, Elo check, matchResult, moment card, finishUnit) is pasted
near-verbatim in 8 `onLegWon*` handlers (~180 lines; the Shanghai copy is
100% generic). **Shape:** one `advanceLegSetGame(winner)` holding the tree;
each mode keeps only its badge checks.

## Item 55 — Scoreboard/pad renderer scaffolding

The five chalkboard renderers (Cricket/Baseball/Shanghai/Halve-It/Pressure
Chamber) share byte-identical headCells/table-assembly/round-banner blocks
(~100 lines); the four single-target pads (+ Cricket's) share identical
preamble/Miss-button trailers (~80 lines); `renderPad()`'s dispatch repeats a
5-line block per mode with a redundant per-branch undo-btn line. **Shape:**
`csHeadCellsHtml()`/`csTableInto()`/`roundBannerInto()` +
`renderSingleTargetPad(spec)` + a `{gameType: renderer}` lookup.

## Item 56 — Dart input/record helpers on the hottest path

The dart-construction block (miss-fill vs `makeDart` + zone/miss/bounce
stamping + `mult=1; updateMultUI()`) is copied in `throwDart`,
`throwDartPressureChamber`, `throwDartCheckoutTrainer` (+ the stamping in
`throwDartKiller`); the single-dart `DB.recordTurn` payload is cloned in five
per-dart modes. **Shape:** `pushThrownDarts(...)` and
`recordSingleDartTurn(...)` helpers — zone-metadata encoding rules then live
once.

## Item 57 — Frontend efficiency batch

(a) `fireMomentCard()` unconditionally paints + JPEG-encodes an 800×800
canvas (~10-30ms main-thread jank + ~250KB POST) and `sendHaWebhook()` fires
a no-op POST per bust/180/leg even when no webhook is configured — expose a
"webhook configured" flag in the boot settings fetch and skip client-side;
(b) `renderPad()` recreates all 22 pad buttons + closures on every dart tap —
build once, toggle `.disabled` (the dartboard branch's own pattern);
(c) `playerSnapshotChuckin()` re-serializes the entire session heatmap into
every per-dart live push — cache and invalidate on change.

## Item 58 — Declarative settings field table

`renderSettings()`'s loader and `saveSettings()` hand-maintain parallel
per-field lists (13 HA webhook fields, 7 voice checkboxes, 8 numerics/toggles
— the loader even already has a `voiceMap` table shape). **Shape:** one
`SETTINGS_FIELDS` array `{key, id, kind, default}` driving both directions;
a new setting then can't be added to save but not load.

## Item 59 — Conventions: badge predicates + DB wrapper boundary

Ten pure badge predicates (hattrick, triplebull, nocigar, …) live inline in
`CHAIN_CHECKS` against the file's own stated convention (culture predicates
moved to scoring.js "so they're covered by a committed test"); move them and
add tests. And the `DB.*` wrapper boundary is unprincipled — three do-nothing
pass-through GET wrappers vs ~122 direct `Backend.get` calls and split
player-mutation homes; either drop the dead wrappers or write the rule down.
